Files within this repository are for testing of the AES256 algorithm

unforunately, this algorithm doesn't seem to work for my purposes very well

continuing to test this algorithm 

kaspersky I believe sometimes detects this as a false positive

so I will be wary of using it on systems with that installed

Decreasing in complexity it seems to work better

unfortunately it still has issues with 

deleting files that are compressed

even when the files are of a really small

size. Even sizes as small as

9KB or even less. Often it has issues with even

1KB or 

1B sizes
